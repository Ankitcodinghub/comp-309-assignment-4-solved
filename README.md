<em>16% of Final Mark —</em>

<h2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives</h2>
The main goal of this assignment is to use a popular machine learning tool, i.e. scikit-learn, to investigate two important factors for the success of machine learning applications, which are performance metrics and metric optimisation through a series of light coding practices. Two supervised learning scenarios will be used, namely classification and regression, and simple coding will also be involved to prepare for more coding work in the final project. The specific objectives of this assignment are:

<li>To analyse and visualise the EDA results to choose appropriate methods for data preprocessing in order toimprove its quality.</li>
</ul>
These topics are (to be) covered in week 7 and week 8, but will also involve content from previous weeks. Research into online resources for AI and machine learning is encouraged. You are required to complete the following questions. For each part, make sure you finish reading all the questions before you start working on it, and your report for the whole assignment should <em>not exceed </em><em>12 pages </em>with font size no smaller than 10.

<h2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions</h2>
<h3>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 1: Performance Metrics in Regression [35 marks]</h3>
This part focuses on performance metrics in regression. The task is to use di↵erent regression methods and di↵erent performance metrics to understand their di↵erences and choose the most appropriate performance metric.

The given <em>Diamonds </em>data set, diamonds.csv, is to predict the price of round cut diamonds. This is a regression task with 10 features (the first 10 columns of diamonds.csv) as the input variables and the feature price (the last column of diamonds.csv) as the output variable. The task here is to learn a regression model to discover the relationship between the output variable and the 10 features/input variables. As we discussed in the lectures/tutorials, to use scikit-learn for regression, you may need the following seven steps:

<ul>
<li>Step 1. Load Data</li>
<li>Step 2. Initial Data Analysis</li>
<li>Step 3. Preprocess Data</li>
<li>Step 4. Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li>Step 5. Build classification (or regression) models using the training data • Step 6. Evaluate models by using cross validation (Optional)</li>
<li>Step 7. Assess model on the test data.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
You are required to use “309” as the random seed to split the data into a training set and a test set, with 70% as the training data and 30% as the test data.

You should use the following 10 regression algorithms implemented in scikit-learn to perform regression. These 10 algorithms are very popular regression methods: (1) linear regression, (2) k-neighbors regression, (3) Ridge regression, (4) decision tree regression, (5) random forest regression, (6) gradient Boosting regression, (7) SGD regression, (8) support vector regression (SVR), (9) linear SVR, and (10) multi-layer perceptron regression. You are encouraged to read the documentation (and provided references if you would like to know more details) about these methods from scikit-learn, e.g. linear regression is implemented in <em>sklearn.linear model.LinearRegression</em>.

Note that you may need to tune the parameters for some of these 10 regression methods to make them work properly or to achieve better performance.

You are required to submit the code of your program, a “readme.txt” file that describes clearly how to run the code, and a report answering the following questions using your own words:

<ul>
<li>If you tune any parameter(s), report which algorithm(s), which parameter(s) and the parameter value(s).</li>
<li>Based on exploratory data analysis, discuss what preprocessing that you need to do before regression, andprovide evidence and justifications.</li>
<li>Please report the results (keep 2 decimals) of all the 10 regression algorithms on themean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-Squared, mean absolute error (MAE), and<em>test </em>data in terms of execution time. You should report them in a table.</li>
<li>Compare the performance of dithen analyse their di↵erences and provide conclusions.↵erent regression algorithms in terms of MSE, RMSE, R-Squared, and MAE,</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 2: Performance Metrics in Classification [35 marks]</h3>
The given <em>Adult </em>dataset is a popular classification data set from the UCI machine learning repository, and the task is to determine whether a person earns a salary of over $50K a year. Separate training and test sets are provided, as adult.train and adult.test, respectively.

You are recommended to follow the steps that we discussed in the lectures/tutorials and listed in Part 1.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
You are required to use 10 classification algorithms implemented in scikit-learn to perform classification. These 10 algorithms are very popular classification methods from di↵erent paradigms of machine learning: (1) kNN, (2) naive Bayes, (3) SVM, (4) decision tree, (5) random forest, (6) AdaBoost, (7) gradient Boosting, (8) linear discriminant analysis, (9) multi-layer perceptron, and (10) logistic regression. You are encouraged to read the documentation (and provided references if you would like to know more details) about these methods from scikit-learn, e.g. kNN is implemented in <em>sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier</em>. We assume that class <em>&gt; </em>50<em>K </em>is the positive class.

You are required to submit the code of your program, a “readme.txt” file that describes clearly how to run the code, and a report answering the following questions using your own words:

<ul>
<li>Based on exploratory data analysis, discuss what preprocessing that you need to do before classification, and provide evidence and justifications.</li>
<li>Please report the results (keep 2 decimals) of all the 10 classification algorithms on the given <em>test </em>data in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. You should report them in a table.</li>
<li>Is accuracy the best performance metric to evaluate a classifier? and why?</li>
<li>Find the two best algorithms according to each of the four performance metrics, Are they the same? Explain why.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 3: Optimisation Methods [30 marks]</h3>
This part focuses mainly on using di↵erent optimisation methods to optimise performance metrics. A code/project template is provided, which implements the batch gradient descent method to optimise MSE during the linear regression learning process, which we name the BGD+MSE method. The template also includes the code for drawing graphs. You are required to modify the code/project template to complete the given questions.

This part of the assignment is based on a regression problem, where the input variable is <em>height</em>(<em>inches</em>), and the output variable is <em>weight</em>(<em>lbs</em>). You are given two sets of data, i.e. Part2.csv with contains 500 examples without any outlier, and Part2Outliers.csv contains 502 examples with two outliers.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
You are required to modify the code/project template to:

<ol>
<li>Implement the mini-batch gradient descent optimiser (mini batch size = 10) based on the given template to optimise MSE for linear regression learning. We name this approach MiniBatchBGD+MSE.</li>
<li>Use the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm, which has been implemented in the provided code, to optimise MSE for linear regression. We name this method PSO+MSE.</li>
<li>Use PSO to optimise MAE for linear regression. We name this method PSO+MAE.</li>
</ol>
By writing the above coding, you now have four methods, i.e. BGD+MSE, MiniBatchBGD+MSE, PSO+MSE, and PSO+MAE. Perform experiments on the provided datasets to answer the following questions and write a report. You are required to submit the code, a “readme.txt” file and the report:

<ol>
<li>On the dataset without outliers, i.e. Part2.csv, use “309” as the random seed to split the dataset into a training set and a test set, with 70% of the data as the training set and 30% as the test set. Run each of the BGD+MSE, MiniBatchBGD+MSE, PSO+MSE, and PSO+MAE methods on the training data to learn a linear regression model and test the learnt model on the test data.
<ul>
<li>Plot the paths of gradient descent of BGD+MSE and MiniBatchBGD+MSE, then discuss their di↵erences and justify why.</li>
<li>Report the results (keep 2 decimals) of the four learnt models over the MSE, R-Squared, and MAE performance metrics on the test set. Compare their results and discuss the di↵erences. You can report them in a table.</li>
<li>Generate a scatter plot with the regression line learnt by PSO+MSE and PSO+MAE and the data points in the test set.</li>
<li>Compare the computational time of the BGD+MSE, MiniBatchBGD+MSE and PSO+MSE methods, find out the fastest one and slowest one, and explain why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the dataset with outliers, i.e. Part2Outliers.csv, split the data and run the PSO+MSE, and PSO+MAE methods in the same way as on the Part2.csv dataset in Question 1. Then:
<ul>
<li>Generate the scatter plot with the regression line learnt by PSO+MSE and PSO+MAE and the data points in the test set.</li>
<li>Compare the above two plots with the two plots you draw in Question 1(c), and discuss which of the two methods (PSO+MSE or PSO+MAE) is less sensitive to outliers and explain why.</li>
<li>Discuss whether we can use gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent to optimise MAE? and explain why.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
